_The Experiment is a horror game designed to entertain and scare the Player. The game starts, and you wake up as a person with amnesia, uncertain of where you are.

As you start to remember, you realize the gaol of the game is to obtain the key and find your way out before the timer runs out. Hope you enjoy!_
